# zomato_analysis

Abstract :
This project analyzes restaurant data from Zomato to uncover trends and insights that can inform business decisions. The dataset includes information about restaurant types, online ordering and table booking availability, ratings, votes, and approximate costs for two people.

Data Cleaning:
The rate column was cleaned to remove non-numeric values (like "NEW" or "-") and convert ratings into numeric values by removing the "/5".
